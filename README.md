# StarsHarvestProto
A game proto made as an assignment.

The default movement is WASD based.
I have no idea if the sound volume is proper or not, at least when testing seemed fine, but just a word of caution,
because there is no audio-options at this point (Didn't have enough time before deadline to do)
